      Hack Playground is a virtual world that brings HackMIT, one of the largest undergraduate hackathons, right to your home. Playground preserves the atmosphere of innovation and connection of a hackathon. You can walk through the Sponsor Town and schedule a coffee chat with a sponsor, gain inspiration by visiting the Nonprofit Village, or chat with other hackers. Not only that, Playground is also a place to have fun, and we hope you’ll have fun trying to earn all the achievements or show off your cool dance moves.
