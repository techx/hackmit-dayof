        <p>
          Kyle Vogt is the CEO and founder of Cruise Automation, the driverless car startup that was acquired for roughly $1 billion by GM in 2016. An engineer at heart, Kyle’s interest in self-driving technology can be traced back to his time at MIT. As an undergrad, he worked on the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, where he co-led a team to retrofit a truck to drive across the Nevada desert. Kyle also co-founded Twitch, Socialcam, and Justin.tv - but his life passion is to deploy self-driving cars at scale in order to make automobile accidents a thing of the past. A native of Kansas City, he currently resides in San Francisco with his wife Tracy and his dog, Charlie.

          Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries from pharmaceuticals to finance and requires a totally different way of thinking about information and constructing algorithms. The IBM quantum research team has made two quantum processors available to the public over the cloud through the IBM Q Experience. Scientists, programmers, and students alike are able to design experiments and learn about quantum computing through a suite of programming tools IBM has introduced. Our software package includes a Python-based API, the QISKit software development kit, our intermediate representation for building quantum circuits called OpenQASM, and a number of Jupyter notebook tutorials for learning and trying out quantum algorithms. The proposed workshop for HackMIT will introduce attendees to QISKit with some fundamental quantum computing examples such as generating superposition states and entanglement. This tutorial will introduce the building blocks of quantum computing using the IBM Q Experience, and hackers can follow along with interactive Python notebooks. Previous knowledge of quantum mechanics is not required, but experience with Python programming is beneficial. The workshop will extend the developing relationship between IBM Q, our quantum brand, and MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics to others in the MIT community. We will give HackMIT participants a chance to get started with programming a quantum computer and begin to understand this fundamentally different and potentially revolutionary type of computing.
