        Project submissions must be in by <b>11:15 AM on Sunday</b> and should be submitted through <a href="https://go.hackmit.org/devpost">DevPost</a>. To submit your project:
      <ul>
        <li>Register for event at <a href="go.hackmit.org/devpost">go.hackmit.org/devpost</a></li>
        <li>Click 'Get started!' and add your project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All projects must be submitted to one of the tracks listed. Projects can additionally be submitted to optional challenges for a chance to win other prizes!
        At the expo, each team will present their projects for a few minutes at a time to small groups of judges in a science-fair format. No need to make a fancy presentation -- the judges will be visiting a lot of tables, so you'll only be giving quick, informal pitches as they walk around the hacking arena! After expo judging ends at <strong>1:00 PM</strong>, the top teams will be chosen for sponsor judging.
