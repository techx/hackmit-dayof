          description: "The InterSystems API Manager (IAM) enables you to monitor and control traffic to and from your web-based APIs. If you are building service-oriented application layers, you are very likely to find the number of APIs you are using quickly rise. The more distributed your environment the more critical it becomes to properly govern and monitor your API traffic. The API Manager enables you easily route all your traffic through a centralized gateway and forward API request to appropriate target nodes."

  title: "Detecting Crashes with Smartphone Data"
  description: "CMT provides a vehicle crash detection service that can detect when a driver has been in a crash using sensors on their smartphone.  This service is used by family safety and insurance applications that are designed to let family members, emergency services, and insurance claims adjusters know that a crash has occurred.  The service provides a number of pieces of information about the crash, including the time and location where it occurred, the speed and severity of the crash, what part of the vehicle was hit, etc.  We have provided the data dictionary and a few sample crash reports provided by the service.  The goal of the challenge is to enrich and present the crash data in the most compelling and creative way. This could include a slick mobile interface, combining other user-supplied or publicly available data, finding a way to make it more actionable for insurance companies, emergency responders or family members: whatever makes this crash data as useful and usable as possible.  This might include capturing audio and video from the driver, photographs of the car, etc.  The interface can be used at the time of the crash to verify that the driver is safe, or some time after the crash to allow the driver to quickly file a claim with their insurance company, or both.   A good submission will combine data from our crash service with additional data in an innovative way.  Examples might include capturing photos and videos of the damaged car and crash scene easily, and matching it to data provided about the location where the crash occurred and what part of the crash was hit, or using speech detection to a driver’s narrative about the crash into structured data automatically. NOTE: Datasets can be found in slack channel or at sponsor room in Playground."

  title: "Best Use of Marquee API by Goldman Sachs"
  description: 'Join Goldman Sachs Engineers this weekend and experience a small taste of the power of our Marquee Platform. For this weekend alone, you will be the only non-clients with access to our Marquee APIs. Explore our COVID-19 or our financial datasets and see if your hack has what it takes to win each of you a prize!
    <br/><br/>
    In light of the challenges brought upon by COVID-19, our engineers—in addition to our traditional financial datasets--have compiled a series of new datasets for students to grasp the global impact of COVD-19 through technology. Understanding that not everyone has the bandwidth to study this in depth, we want to give you the opportunity to create new projects, models, and technologies surrounding a circumstance that has affected millions of lives globally. We want you to be creative and leverage new ideas to help you (and all of us) understand COVID-19 better.
    <br/><br/>
    If you are interested in competing in this challenge, please fill out <a href="https://go.hackmit.org/goldmansachs">go.hackmit.org/goldmansachs</a> in order to have access to their Marquee API prior to and during the event. This form by no means binds you to competing in their challenge.'

  title: "Best Panel Data Visualization"
  description: 'We are looking for the best data visualization hack using panel data. At Arrowstreet, we work with hundreds of financial datasets to generate thousands of statistics every day. These panel data sets (<a href="http://bit.ly/3hkb7QS">http://bit.ly/3hkb7QS</a>) contain data for a variety of cross sections (assets, companies, countries, etc.) and time frequencies (intraday, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).
    <br/><br/>
    The winning data visualization will help users to understand and explore panel data by presenting multiple dimensions, highlighting conclusions, and handling real world data challenges like missing or invalid values. The visualization can use any publicly available data set and does not need to use financial data.
    <br/><br/>
    Submissions will be evaluated across 4 dimensions:<br/>
    1.	Does the project effectively communicate findings about the data set, while encouraging users to ask questions and explore other ideas?<br/>
    2.	Does the project include innovations in technical design, data / statistical analysis or user experience?<br/>
    3.	Does the visualization creatively address the complexities of working with real-world panel datasets, in terms of missing data, variety in cross sectional units, and variety in time horizons?<br/>
    4.	Does the project demonstrate a high level of professionalism in terms of performance, user interface, and visuals?<br/>'

  title: "Green Compute Challenge"
  description: "MIT and IBM are coming together to offer the \"green compute challenge\" at HackMIT!
    <br/><br/>
    From AI machine learning to large climate prediction models, high-performance computing is helping us make the world a better place. At the same time, high-performance computing is extremely energy intensive. Some predictions using current growth rates show that AI computing alone will take more than 30% of the worlds energy resources by the end of the 2030's. We can't let that happen!!!! 
    <br/><br/>
    MIT currently leads the word in green supercomputing with the IBM donated <a href=https://news.mit.edu/2020/brainstorming-energy-saving-hacks-satori-mit-supercomputer-0211>MIT Satori Supercomputer</a> which lives in the 97% renewable energy <a href=https://www.mghpcc.org/>Mass Green High-Performance Computing Center</a>. A typical high performance benchmark on Satori, if run repeatedly for a year, would use about 5 maple trees worth of carbon vs. about 280 maple trees worth of carbon running in a \"typical\" high-end data center. That's a 60x difference!!!  
    <br/><br/>
    The HackMIT MIT-IBM Green Compute Challenge is looking for ways to help lower the carbon footprint of all high performance computation by raising people's awareness of the carbon cost of their computing. The winning solution will receive $500 for the project that helps make energy and/or carbon awareness easier...and more fun...to calculate. We have lots of ideas and input data on the energy efficiency of various computer platforms, the energy mix of data centers by geography, etc, and would love to help you formulate your solution. 
    <br/><br/>
    Come help us change the world and make green high performance computing a reality."
