  title: "CMTâ€™s Vehicle Crash Data Challenge"
  description: "CMT provides a vehicle crash detection service that can detect when a driver has been in a crash using sensors on their smartphone. This service is used by family safety and insurance applications that are designed to let family members, emergency ðŸš’ services, and insurance claims applications know that a crash has occurred. The service provides a number of pieces of information about the crash, including the time and location where it occurred, the speed and severity of the crash, what part of the vehicle was hit, etc. We have provided the data dictionary and a few sample crash reports provided by the service. The goal of the challenge is to enrich and present the crash data in the most compelling and creative way. This could include a slick mobile interface, combining other user-supplied or publicly-available data, finding a way to make it more actionable for insurance companies, emergency responders or family members: whatever makes this crash data as useful and usable as possible. Two things to remember: 1) the smartphone is a feature-rich and powerful tool, and 2) tools are only as good as humansâ€™ ability to use them."

  title: "Best Use of Marquee API by Goldman Sachs"
  description: "Join Goldman Sachs Engineers this weekend and experience a small taste of the power of our Marquee Platform. For this weekend alone, you will be the only non-clients with access to our Marquee APIs. Explore our COVID-19 or our financial datasets and see if your hack has what it takes to win each of you a prize!
  <br/>
  In light of the challenges brought upon by COVID-19, our engineersâ€”in addition to our traditional financial datasets--have compiled a series of new datasets for students to grasp the global impact of COVD-19 through technology. Understanding that not everyone has the bandwidth to study this in depth, we want to give you the opportunity to create new projects, models, and technologies surrounding a circumstance that has affected millions of lives globally. We want you to be creative and leverage new ideas to help you (and all of us) understand COVID-19 better.
  <br/>
  COVID-19 datasets: (https://developer.gs.com/docs/covid/)                                                                Financial datasets: (https://marquee.gs.com/s/discover/data-services/catalog)

  If you are interested in competing in this challenge, please fill out go.hackmit.org/goldmansachs in order to have access to their Marquee API prior to and during the event. This form by no means binds you to competing in their challenge."

  title: "Best Panel Data Visualization"
  description: "We are looking for the best data visualization hack using panel data. At Arrowstreet, we work with hundreds of financial datasets to generate thousands of statistics every day. These panel data sets (http://bit.ly/3hkb7QS) contain data for a variety of cross sections (assets, companies, countries, etc.) and time frequencies (intraday, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.). The winning data visualization will help users to understand and explore panel data by presenting multiple dimensions, highlighting conclusions, and handling real world data challenges like missing or invalid values. The visualization can use any publicly available data set and does not need to use financial data."
