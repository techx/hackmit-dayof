Using any of our dev tools qualifies your team for prizes. However, the judging team will give preference to teams that demonstrate creative competence by:
+Using one of the SDK's
+Writing to and reading from the `note` field in a transaction
+Using multiple dev tools

An example solution would be to: Build a solution for easy account management using one our SDK's, the solution should be able to:
Create and sign transactions, do the same with multisig accounts, recover accounts from mnemonic phrases
Bonus: Build a UI for the solution (command line, web based or other) in any language.

- How _useful_ is it? Does this solve either a need or want for developers in their workflow? Does it make sense to build/use this as a command line tool and not as a webapp? Clear cases where a developer would turn to your tool are better than tools which try to do everything but don't address a specific problem.

- How _usable_ is it? Is it clear what commands a developer can use, and which ones are optional or required? Is it easy to execute repetitive or common flows, as well as discover less common ones if needed? What happens when there is a very long running process - is my only option to escape, or can I run other work concurrently, and why? Do the names and commands make sense?

Note that usefulness and usability have a few key differences, and both will be important to win.

Complexity in scope, performance, and \"fun\" are bonuses :)"

  description: "Hospitals and clinics around the US and the world face an unprecedented challenge in keeping patient data secure. This challenge has only increased in magnitude with the wide adoption of cloud-based solutions and applications for managing everything from billing to increasingly regulated protected health information (PHI). 

It is not atypical for Healthcare workers to have to move from room to room and from device to device throughout their day. Often, this includes having to go through lengthy and complicated logon processes for both devices and applications to do anything from simply looking at a patient chart to signing prescriptions. Imprivata provides solutions that enable those Healthcare workers with fast and easy access to all of their devices, applications and patient data. Imprivata does this while providing the most secure, but transparent approach, to handling both healthcare worker data and the data of the patients that they have to support. Keeping this in mind...

The winner(s) of this challenge will develop the most creative and secure hack that manages user data. The winning hack should focus on things such as novel approaches to user data encryption or advanced authentication methods (think password-less) to access that data. 

Bonus consideration will be given for hacks that include...

* Specific healthcare application 
* Use more than one, non-password based, authentication method
* Provide simple, fast user data access
* Leverage devices that healthcare workers already have (fitness trackers, cell phones, etc...)"
