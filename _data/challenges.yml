+Using one of the SDK's <br/>
+Writing to and reading from the `note` field in a transaction <br/>

  description: "At LightStep, we build product for developers in many different companies and parts of the world. The command line is the basic starting point for a lot of our work as developers, but there's a lot that goes into making a great one. Specifically:
<br/>
- How <i>useful</i> is it? Does this solve either a need or want for developers in their workflow? Does it make sense to build/use this as a command line tool and not as a webapp? Clear cases where a developer would turn to your tool are better than tools which try to do everything but don't address a specific problem.
<br/>
- How <i>usable</i> is it? Is it clear what commands a developer can use, and which ones are optional or required? Is it easy to execute repetitive or common flows, as well as discover less common ones if needed? What happens when there is a very long running process - is my only option to escape, or can I run other work concurrently, and why? Do the names and commands make sense?
<br/><br/>
Note that usefulness and usability have a few key differences, and both will be important to win.

This challenge has only increased in magnitude with the wide adoption of cloud-based solutions and applications for managing everything from billing to increasingly regulated protected health information (PHI). 
<br/><br/>
It is not atypical for Healthcare workers to have to move from room to room and from device to device throughout their day. Often, this includes having to go through lengthy and complicated logon processes for both devices and applications to do anything from simply looking at a patient chart to signing prescriptions. Imprivata provides solutions that enable those Healthcare workers with fast and easy access to all of their devices, applications and patient data. Imprivata does this while providing the most secure, but transparent approach, to handling both healthcare worker data and the data of the patients that they have to support. Keeping this in mind...
<br/><br/>
The winner(s) of this challenge will develop the most creative and secure hack that manages user data. The winning hack should focus on things such as novel approaches to user data encryption or advanced authentication methods (think password-less) to access that data. 
<br/><br/>
Bonus consideration will be given for hacks that include...<br/>

* Specific healthcare application <br/>
* Use more than one, non-password based, authentication method<br/>
* Provide simple, fast user data access <br/>
* Leverage devices that healthcare workers already have (fitness trackers, cell phones, etc...)"

   We challenge you to think about and do the same--<i>make something which takes a messy data set and makes it friendlier, easier to use, or more explorable</i>.  This can be anything from a UI for data exploration to a better way of writing queries.
