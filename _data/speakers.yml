      title: Assessing Bias in Artificial Intelligence Models
      description: "Machine Learning is beginning to filter into daily life, with real-world use cases such as AI for resume filtering, Google Translate, and more. However, very little has been done to ensure that these systems are fair. For example, Amazon’s attempt to use AI for resume filtering actively discriminated against women, and Google Translate assumes the gender of an occupation: “He is a scientist, she is a nurse, he is an engineer, etc”. Come for a talk about the first large-scale study about bias in machine learning models, and learn more about the current state of AI! No prior programming experience required."

      title: "Decoding for Dummies: How to Crack Ciphers Using Machine Learning"
      description: Divya Gopinath and Rohan Kodialam are Master's students at MIT, having graduated from undergrad last year (Rohan was a double major with physics, and Divya minored in music). They are both from the tri-state area and think New England is overrated, with the sole exception of MIT. Their research interests lie in algorithms and machine learning, and when not in lab, they like to lament the lack of good bagels and pizza in Boston.

      title: Design For America
      description: MIT Design for America was founded in 2012 by a group of students who believed that making a difference did not have to wait until after graduation. From that thought, Design for America was born as the hub of creating social impact with design and engineering at MIT.

      title: Design Build Fly
      description: We are a team of undergraduate and graduate students at MIT that develop aircraft for the annual AIAA Design/Build/Fly competition. Our students gain experience in conceptual design, multidisciplinary optimization, aerodynamic, sturctural and propulsive analysis, composite layups, CAD software, UAV fabrication and RC flight.
