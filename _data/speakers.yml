    - name: Olivia Brode-Roger
      title: How does a computer work?
      description: "Olivia is incredibly excited about... just about anything. At MIT, she switched majors 4 times and took a year to work for iCivics, a civic education non-profit. She’s still at MIT for her Master’s. Her days are filled by teaching: she teaches, takes classes about teaching, and is researching teaching techniques. She particularly loves taking what seems ordinary and revealing inner awesomeness - be it in her students, or in a computer system."
    - name: Divya Gopinath + Rohan Kodialam
      title: "Decoding for Dummies: How to Crack Ciphers Using Machine Learning"
      description: Divya Gopinath and Rohan Kodialam are seniors majoring in Course 6 (Rohan’s a double major with physics, and Divya’s minoring in music). They are both from the tri-state area and think New England is overrated, with the sole exception of MIT. Their research interests lie in algorithms and machine learning, and they are both sticking around campus for another year to complete their Master’s degrees. When they are not in class, lab, rehearsal (Divya), or their frat house (Rohan), they like to lament the lack of good bagels and pizza in Boston.

      title: Rockets 101
