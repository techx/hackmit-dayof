    - name: IBM panel
      time: 4:45 - 5:15 PM
      link: https://go.hackmit.org/workshop
      description: "The existential threats of the COVID-19 pandemic have proven how AI and machine learning tools can serve a critical role in preventing disease transmission, tracking and responding to virus outbreaks, and expediting drug and vaccine development processes that are traditionally far too expensive and inefficient.  Yet while these tools have revolutionized how critical data on COVID-19 is gathered, analyzed, and acted upon, there is still all too much work to be done in effectively preventing, tracking, and treating the virus.  Technology alone is only a starting point: effective public health innovations cannot succeed without an underlying commitment to equity, access, and affordability.  Furthermore, while there is an exponential growth in relevant apps, digital interfaces, and virtual diagnostic tools that seek to address the COVID-19 pandemic, all too many of these efforts are siloed within standalone organizations, campaigns, or research centers.  This panel will highlight best practice and key challenges facing these efforts to date, and will explore how to:
        <br/><br/>
        1)  Focus on equity and accessibility in all COVID-19 prevention and response strategies so that these efforts don’t perpetuate existing biases and disenfranchisement in healthcare systems;
        <br/><br/>
        2)  Solve for the unmet needs, inefficiencies, and market gaps within current AI tools for addressing COVID-19, through partnership and transparency rather than competition; and
        <br/><br/>
        3)  Increase open collaboration between the higher education, technology, government, and healthcare sectors to further improve upon and accelerate large-scale solutions"

They are initially focusing on the health system of India, where population growth is out-pacing clinical capacity. In 2006 Linda envisioned and co-founded 23andMe, which has become the world's largest consumer interactive genetics research platform. The idea stemmed from her work at Affymetrix and Perlegen Sciences, early tech providers in the genetics industry. Her involvement with patient communities cemented the idea that people would be willing to share their data in order to make progress in understanding their diseases. Today, millions of individuals are participating in 23andMe research studies, providing statistical power needed to make significant progress not feasible through academic models.
