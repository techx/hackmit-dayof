- prompt: I CAME LATE / I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO!
  answer: Come to Help Desk and we’ll get you up to speed!
- prompt: WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A TEAM?
  answer: No worries! We’ll be holding a team formation event Saturday morning to allow hackers who came without a team to find one. Feel free to also form spontaneous teams with new friends you meet through the HackMIT Facebook group, the HackMIT Slack, or throughout the weekend!
- prompt: HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED ON A TEAM?
  answer: Teams can be up to four people.
- prompt: WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BUILD OR HACK THIS WEEKEND?
  answer: There are no constraints on what you can build this weekend! Your finished hack doesn’t have to be polished or perfect; HackMIT is also a great way to explore and learn new things. We hope our event is a launchpad for you to continue hacking on your project past this weekend!
