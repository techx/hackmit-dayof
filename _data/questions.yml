  answer: There are no constraints on what you can build! Your finished hack doesn’t have to be polished or perfect; HackMIT is also a great way to explore and learn new things. We hope our event is a launchpad for you to continue hacking on your project past this weekend!

# - prompt: ARE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR SWAG?
#   answer: Unfortunately no. We won’t be able to support hackers in this regard due to high shipping expenses accrued when shipping internationally. 

- prompt: WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECEIVING SWAG?
  answer: You must fill out both of our track questionnaires and submit a project to be eligible. Unfortunately our fulfillment center doesn’t ship internationally, so swag will only be shipped out domestically. Sorry for the inconvenience! If you have an alternate address in the United States, we can use that instead.

- prompt: WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR COFFEE CHATS?
  answer: If you are a high school student, then you are unfortunately not eligible for coffee chats with sponsors. Additionally, each company may have its own guidelines on conducting coffee chats with international students.
