- prompt: What are factions?
  answer: We created factions to encourage hackers to have fun and interact with each other outside of normal teams when you're not working on your projects. The Red Faction and Blue Faction are hackathon-wide groups that collectively complete challenges at HackMIT 2017 for points. The faction with the most points will win and get a surprise upon the conclusion of the hackathon and get the coveted Faction Cup. You should have already chosen your faction when you registered!
- prompt: How do I earn points for my faction?
  answer: The more you engage with HackMIT this weekend (attend workshops, meet other hackers, tweet team selfies, etc.), the more points you will earn for your faction! The specifics are secret ;) HackMIT organizers and volunteers will be scanning your badge to award faction points, so be sure to keep your badge with you at all times.
- prompt: Can team members belong to different factions?
  answer: Yes, factions do not limit your forming of individual teams.
