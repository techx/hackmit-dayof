- prompt: I came late / I don’t know where to go!
  answer: Come to Help Desk and we’ll get you up to speed!
- prompt: What if I don’t have a team?
  answer: No worries! We’ll be holding a team formation event Sunday morning to allow hackers who came without a team to find one. Feel free to also form spontaneous teams with new friends you meet through the Blueprint Facebook group or throughout the weekend!
- prompt: How many people are allowed on a team?
  answer: Teams can be up to four people.
- prompt: What am I supposed to build/hack this weekend?
  answer: There are no constraints on what you can build on Sunday! Your finished hack doesn’t have to be polished or perfect; we know there isn’t nearly enough time to build a big project -- we hope Blueprint is a launchpad for you to continue hacking on it past this weekend!
